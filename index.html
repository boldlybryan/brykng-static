        <p class="text-justify mb2">Flagstar Bank has over 200 loan officers that work hard to get customers into the home of their dreams. Our task was to build an application for these employees to have their own profiles on Flagstar.com. My job was to create of a template for the profiles and a invent a CSS library for our responsive site. I'm glad to say that this project was a success! The loan officers can now interact with customers in ways that were impossible before.</p>

        <h3 class="mb1">Location Pages</h3>
        <p class="text-justify mb2">With over 100 locations around the country, Flagstar needed to provide a way for customers to learn more about their neighborhood branch. As a part of a renovation of our Home Loans section, I was tasked with redoing the location pages. Visitors can see contact information, services offered, and the loan officers assigned to a branch. My work included restructuring the markup of the existing pages, utilizing Bootstrap to accomplish the layout. Also I wrote new CSS to comply with a new style.</p>

        <p class="text-justify mb2">I've had the pleasure of working with my wonderful fiancee, Katie, to design our wedding experience. I took on the design and development of our website. We wanted it to be a source of information for our guests to learn more about the plans for our big day. It had to be easy to use on smartphones, where we anticipate the majority of our traffic to come from. In order to accomplish this, I utilized my personal CSS framework to create an elegant layout.</p>

        <p class="text-justify mb2">While I designed and developed my portfolio, I took it as an opportunity to build a new CSS library for my own personal use. Based off the principles in atomic design and functional CSS, I made a system that made sense to me. I'm pleased with its small size, which allows me to create sites that put performance first. Also, it allows for semantic markup, which translates into a site that is both a11y and SEO friendly. It is constantly a work in progress and I look forward to using it on future projects.</p>
